# Warehouse loading tracker app

This will be the start of a web app that tracks the loader sections work. It will help keep all employees up to date with whats loaded, in process and missing, allowing for more efficient work to be done with everyone involved.

## Basic outline

A simple table that tracks 5 things:
- Shipment route (PR23##, ###C/U or Client name)
- Shipment box amount (75/75 or 60/63)
- Delivery Vehicle ID (Trucks - 585 / Vans - 26XX, 507)
- Fill rate / Amount of missing or unavailable items
- Status ( complete, in-process, pending )
